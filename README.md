Big group project involving Me, Jaren and Moises. Day 1, Me and Jaren began our work when Moises announced he would leave before we'd finish the project, focused on wireframe. Day 2, Moises was gone but submitted his wireframes, Me and Jaren continued to focus wireframes, Jaren was occasionally sidetracked. Day 3, Finished up wireframes and got them approved, finally began HTML and CSS, I set up the color scheme by this time. Day 4, set up Home page and got started on products. Prioritized HTML for each page before focusing on CSS. Day 5, Finished HTML, began to do CSS for each page, needed to revise HTML every and now and then after checking how it looked with CSS. Day 6, finally began to do Media Queries, was unable to do Media until finished with HTML and CSS. Day 7, focused mostly on getting Media as accurate as we could to the wireframes, how to make compromises due to our inability to completely make them accurate to said wireframes unless we restarted completely.
Jaren: HTML and CSS contributer (media queries for most of contact, products, and home. Setup most HTMLS initially along with creating images for website.)
Moises: (Left Early)
Esaih: HTML and CSS contributer( Did most HTML and CSS for FAQ and about, including Media Queries. Prioritized CSS and making it seem more fitting.)
Issues with making css and html completely accurate, unable to make drop down menus without restarting completely over, rare inability to fill screen with certain devices.
